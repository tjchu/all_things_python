# Python Deliberate Practice
This repository contains random Python code that I wrote to improve myself as a Python developer.
My career aspiration is to be the best Python developer that I can be. 
In order to improve my Python skills, I aim to constantly perform deliberate practice when writing Python scripts. If you've never heard of the phrase "deliberate practice", check it out here: https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory

If you stumbled upon this repository, there are many Python scripts that I wrote that may contain useful things for you to reference. Such as finding files in a directory, finding a string in a text file, parse a string and determine if it's a valid string with appropriate brackets/parenthesis etc. 

There are also Python code implementing algorithms that are often asked in coding interviews: merge sort, quick sort, binary search, depth first search, breadth first search etc.

Check them out :)
